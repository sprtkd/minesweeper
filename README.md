move a bot over a surface searching for IR strobes using image processing

This was made for an IP robotics competition in IIEST ,Shibpur,India.

The objective was to make an arduino based bot with ir sensors below,a motor driver,a bluetooth module hc 05
and a buzzer..
The best part...We won the competition....!!!!!!!
The image processing was done with a webcam hanging above the arena filled with 10 green blobs.

our task was to find in which of those green blobs there where ir lights.

the main code was written on matlab.

commands were sent over bluetooth.
